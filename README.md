CHRIS (Cognitive Health Review Information System)
A Python-based system for processing electronic health record surveys and generating comprehensive clinical notes for cognitive and dementia assessments.
Overview
CHRIS automates the collection and processing of Patient-Centered Outcome Measures (PCOMs) to generate detailed clinical assessments. The system processes survey responses from caregivers and patients, then creates structured clinical notes suitable for medical documentation and billing compliance (including CPT 99483).
Core Components
Survey Processing (Ptsurvey.py)
Classes:

Survey: Main survey processor for comprehensive CHRIS assessments
Survey99483: Specialized processor for 99483 billing code assessments

Key Features:

Processes multiple question types: free text, forced choice, yes/maybe/no, multiple response, and embedded surveys
Maps survey responses to clinical variables
Handles complex nested surveys (eCOG, NPI-Q, Zarit, etc.)
Validates and scores standardized assessment instruments

Survey Data Structure:
pythonsections = {
    'intro': {},           # Patient demographics and caregiver info
    'demographics': {},    # Basic patient information
    'medhx': {},          # Medical history
    'memory': {},         # Memory assessment (eCOG Memory)
    'executive': {},      # Executive function (eCOG Executive)
    'language': {},       # Language assessment (eCOG Language)
    'visuospatial': {},   # Spatial abilities (eCOG Visuospatial)
    'behavioral': {},     # NPI-Q, PHQ-9, GAD-7 assessments
    'functional': {},     # FAQ, ADL assessments
    'caregiverstress': {} # Zarit Burden Interview, NPI-Q Caregiver
}
Clinical Note Generation (Writeptnote.py)
Classes:

Ptnote: Generates comprehensive clinical notes
Ptnote99483: Specialized notes for 99483 billing compliance

Output Formats:

Microsoft Word documents (.docx)
Plain text files
Structured clinical narratives

Note Structure:

History of Present Illness (HPI): Comprehensive review of symptoms by domain
Assessment: Clinical interpretation with severity staging
Care Plan: Evidence-based recommendations and safety considerations
Scores: Quantified assessment results with percentiles

Configuration Files
survey.yaml / survey99483.yaml: Survey question mappings

Question text and response options
Question types and validation rules
Scoring parameters

ptnote.yaml: Clinical narrative templates

Standardized language for assessment domains
Severity descriptors and clinical interpretations
Scoring thresholds and recommendations

Supported Assessment Instruments
Cognitive Assessments

eCOG (Everyday Cognition Scale): Memory, Executive, Language, Visuospatial
FAQ (Functional Activities Questionnaire): Instrumental ADLs
ADL (Activities of Daily Living): Basic self-care abilities
DSRS (Dementia Severity Rating Scale): 99483 version only

Behavioral/Psychiatric

NPI-Q (Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire): Behavioral symptoms
PHQ-9: Depression screening
GAD-7: Anxiety assessment
Zarit Burden Interview: Caregiver stress

Specialized Assessments

Epworth Sleepiness Scale: Sleep disorders
Safety Checklist: Home safety and driving concerns
Hoarding Assessment: Clutter and acquisition behaviors (99483)

Clinical Workflow

Survey Completion: Caregiver/patient completes online assessment
Data Processing: Survey class parses responses and validates data
Clinical Interpretation: Ptnote class generates narrative assessment
Document Generation: Creates Word document with clinical note
Provider Review: Clinician reviews and finalizes assessment

Research and Development
CHRIS serves as a platform for:

Clinical decision support algorithm development
Natural language processing research
Health outcomes research
Implementation science studies

The system has processed over 1,700 clinical assessments and supports ongoing research into AI-enhanced cognitive care delivery.

CHRIS was developed by Dr. Peter Pressman and represents a comprehensive approach to standardizing and enhancing cognitive assessment in clinical practice.
